# Building and Evaluating Multiple Linear Regression Models

## Overview:
This project focuses on building and evaluating multiple linear regression models using Python. We leverage the scikit-learn library to calculate the regression, while utilizing pandas for data management and seaborn for data visualization. The dataset used in this project is the Advertising dataset, which predicts sales revenue based on advertising spending through TV, radio, and newspaper channels.

## Learning Objectives:
- Build univariate and multivariate linear regression models using scikit-learn.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization with seaborn.
- Evaluate model fit and accuracy using numerical measures such as RÂ² and RMSE.
- Model interaction effects in regression using basic feature engineering techniques.

## Recommended Experience:
Basic familiarity with programming in Python and an understanding of linear regression concepts are recommended for this project.

## Tools Used:
- Python 3.7
- Jupyter Notebooks
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- seaborn

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Jupyter Notebooks and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) to follow along with the project.

This project provides hands-on experience in building and evaluating linear regression models, making it ideal for individuals looking to enhance their data analysis skills.
